# Cats_Vs_Dogs-CNN

This is my first Data Science project using Cats V Dogs dataset https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765. The network is made out of 3 CNNs
with 64 neurons each, and 2 Dense Layers. I've experimented with different batch sizes, epochs, number of neurons/layers but I've got pretty much the same result. (acc ~80%)

I've also added a simple interface so I could play with images from the internet. I'll come back to this project when I learn more.
